# react-demo
This is a tutorial project for howto make a React app with Typescript & MobX

We are using the following technologies:
- React router
- MobX
- Typescript
- Axios

Here we create an application structure more like Java / Spring than standard React Javascript functional programming while I think this is a much nicer way to structure the code.

The reasons why I think this is a much nicer development experiance than Javascript functional programming are:

- Using Typescript you always know what is available for every object directly whne you are coding and replace finding spelling errors from runtime to development time.
- Using classes you can encapsulate the logic in a good manner.
- Using MobX for state management is much cleaner and easier than Hooks and less verbose than Redux.
- Using MobX dependency injection makes it easy to find & use the common services/stores.

Views in the application:
	- Login
	- Main page
	- User list
